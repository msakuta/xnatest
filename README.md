xnatest
=======

A Minecraft style game test project with Microsoft XNA Game Studio.

This is my personal test project.  You would find little benefit
in searching this project's sources.  If you'd like to hack with Minecraft
based game engine, see Minetest:

This is also pretty old project.  It can be built with Visual Studio 2010.
